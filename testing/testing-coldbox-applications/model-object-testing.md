# Model Object Testing

You can test all your model objects directly with no need of doing integration testing. This way you can unit test model objects very very easily using great mocking capabilities. All you need to do is the following:

```
coldbox create model-test path=models.UserService methods=save,list,search --open
```

This testing support class will create your model object, and decorate with mocking capabilities via MockBox and create some mocking classes you might find useful in your model object unit testing. The following are the objects that are placed in the variables scope for you to use:

* `model` : The target model object to test
* `mockLogger` : A mock logger class
* `mockLogBox` : A mock LogBox class
* `mockCacheBox` : A mock Cache Factory class
* `mockWireBox` : A mock WireBox Injector class

> **Caution** We do not initialize your model objects for you. This is your job as you might need some mocking first.

Basic Setup

```javascript
/**
* The base model test case will use the 'model' annotation as the instantiation path
* and then create it, prepare it for mocking and then place it in the variables scope as 'model'. It is your
* responsibility to update the model annotation instantiation path and init your model.
*/
component extends="coldbox.system.testing.BaseModelTest" model="UserService"{

    /*********************************** LIFE CYCLE Methods ***********************************/

    function beforeAll(){
        // setup the model
        super.setup();        

        // init the model object
        model.init();
    }

    function afterAll(){
    }

    /*********************************** BDD SUITES ***********************************/

    function run(){

        describe( "UserService Suite", function(){

            it( "should save", function(){

            });

            it( "should search", function(){

            });

            it( "should list", function(){

            });


        });

    }

}
```
