# Test Annotations

Here are the annotations you can add to your testing bundle CFC to change behavior:

| Annotation      | Type    | Required | Default                           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| --------------- | ------- | -------- | --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `appMapping`    | string  | false    | `/`                               | The application mapping of the ColdBox application to test. By defaults it maps to the root. Extremely important this mapping is a slash notation that points to the root of the ColdBox application to test.           |
| `configMapping` | string  | false    | `{appMapping}/config/Coldbox.cfc` | The configuration file to load for this test, which by convention uses the same configuration as the application uses. This is a dot notation path to a configuration CFC.                                              |
| `coldboxAppKey` | string  | false    | `cbController`                    | The named key of the ColdBox controller that will be placed in application scope for you to simulate the ColdBox application. Used mostly on advanced testing cases where you have altered the default application key. |
| `loadColdBox`   | boolean | false    | true                              | By default the base test case will load the virtual application into the `application`scope so all specs can execute                                                                                                    |
| `unloadColdBox` | boolean | false    | true                              | The base test case will unload the virtual application from the `application` scope after all specs have executed.                                                                                                      |

**Examples**

```javascript
component extends="coldbox.system.testing.BaseTestCase" appMapping="/apps/MyApp"{}

component extends="coldbox.system.testing.BaseTestCase"
    appMapping="/apps/MyApp" 
    configMapping="apps.MyApp.test.resources.Config"{}
```

> **Caution** The `AppMapping` setting is the most important one. This is how your test connects to a location of a ColdBox application to test.
