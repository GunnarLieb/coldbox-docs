# Executing Events

Apart from executing events from the URL/FORM or Remote interfaces, you can also execute events internally, either **public** or **private** from within your event handlers or from interceptors, other handlers, layouts or views.&#x20;

## RunEvent()

You do this by using the `runEvent()` method which is inherited from our `FrameworkSuperType` class. Here is the method signature:

```javascript
/**
* Executes events with full life-cycle methods and returns the event results if any were returned.
* @event The event string to execute, if nothing is passed we will execute the application's default event.
* @prePostExempt If true, pre/post handlers will not be fired. Defaults to false
* @private Execute a private event if set, else defaults to public events
* @defaultEvent The flag that let's this service now if it is the default event running or not. USED BY THE FRAMEWORK ONLY
* @eventArguments A collection of arguments to passthrough to the calling event handler method
* @cache Cached the output of the runnable execution, defaults to false. A unique key will be created according to event string + arguments.
* @cacheTimeout The time in minutes to cache the results
* @cacheLastAccessTimeout The time in minutes the results will be removed from cache if idle or requested
* @cacheSuffix The suffix to add into the cache entry for this event rendering
* @cacheProvider The provider to cache this event rendering in, defaults to 'template'
*/
function runEvent(
	event="",
	boolean prePostExempt=false,
	boolean private=false,
	boolean defaultEvent=false,
	struct eventArguments={},
	boolean cache=false,
	cacheTimeout="",
	cacheLastAccessTimeout="",
	cacheSuffix="",
	cacheProvider="template"
)
```

The interesting aspect of internal executions is that all the same rules apply, so your handlers can return content like widgets, views, or even data. Also, the **eventArguments** enables you to pass arguments to the method just like method calls:

### **Executions**

```javascript
//public event
runEvent( 'users.save' );

//post exempt
runEvent( event='users.save', prePostExempt=true );

//Private event
runEvent( event='users.persist', private=true );

// Run event as a widget
<cfoutput>#runEvent(
    event         = 'widgets.userInfo',
    prePostExempt = true,
    eventArguments= { widget=true }
)#</cfoutput>

// Run with Caching
runEvent( event="users.list", cache=true, cacheTimeout=30 );
```

### **Declaration**

```javascript
// handler responding to widget call
function userInfo( event, rc, prc, widget=false ){

    prc.userInfo = userService.get( rc.id );

    // set or widget render
    if( arguments.widget ){
        return view( "widgets/userInfo" );
    }

    // else set view
    event.setView( "widgets/userInfo" );
}
```

### Caching

As you can see from the function signature you can tell ColdBox to cache the result of the event call.  All of the cached content will go into the **template** cache by default unless you use the `cacheProvider` argument. The cache keys are also based on the name of the event and the signature of the `eventArguments` structure.  Meaning, the framework can cache multiple permutations of the same event call as long as the `eventArguments` are different.

```javascript
runEvent( event="users.widget", eventArguments={ max=10, page=1 }, cache=true );

// Cached as a new key
runEvent( event="users.widget", eventArguments={ max=10, page=2 }, cache=true );

```

**Tip**: You can disable event caching by using the `coldbox.eventCaching` directive in your `config/ColdBox.cfc`
{% endhint %}
