# Requirements

Routing is enabled by **default** in the ColdBox application templates in order to work with URL's like this:

`http://localhost/index.cfm/home/about`

As you can see they still contain the `index.cfm` in the URL. In order to enable full URL rewrites that eliminates that `index.cfm` you must have a rewrite enabled webserver like Apache, nginx or IIS or a Java rewrite filter which ships with CommandBox by **default**.

`http://localhost/home/about`

CommandBox has built in rewrites powered by Tuckey and you can enable a server with rewrites by running:

```
server start --rewritesEnable
```

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Caution** Some J2EE servlet containers do not support the forwarding of SES parameters via the routing template (`index.cfm`) out of the box. You might need to enable full URL rewriting either through a web server or a J2EE filter.
