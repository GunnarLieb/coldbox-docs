# Scaffold

Now let us relish in the power of the `orm-crud` command:

```bash
coldbox create orm-crud entity=models.Contacts pluralName=Contacts
```

That's it.

```
Generated Handler: /Users/lmajano/tmp/restapp/handlers/Contacts.cfc
Generated View: /Users/lmajano/tmp/restapp/views/Contacts/edit.cfm
Generated View: /Users/lmajano/tmp/restapp/views/Contacts/editor.cfm
Generated View: /Users/lmajano/tmp/restapp/views/Contacts/new.cfm
Generated View: /Users/lmajano/tmp/restapp/views/Contacts/index.cfm
```

The command will create the handler with RESTFul capabilities, the views and all the necessary machinery for you to manage Contacts! Now go get a nice latte in celebration!
