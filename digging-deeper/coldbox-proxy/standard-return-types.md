# Standard Return Types

The `ColdBox.cfc` has one setting that affects proxy operation:

* `ProxyReturnCollection` : This boolean setting determines if the proxy should return what the event handlers return or just return the request collection structure every time a `process()` method is called. This can be a very useful setting, if you don't even want to return any data from the handlers (via the `process()` method). The framework will just always return the request collection structure back to the proxy caller. By default, the framework has this setting turned to **false** so you can have more control and flexibility.

```javascript
coldbox.proxyReturnCollection = true;
```
