# Module Bundles

You can bundle your modules into an organizational folder that has the convention name of `{name}-bundle`. This will allow you to bundle different modules together for organizational purposes only. Great for git ignores.

```
coldbox-bundle
  * cbstorages
  * cborm
  * cbsecurity
```
