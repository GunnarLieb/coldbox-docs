# Environment Control

If you are using per-environment control in your parent application via the `ColdBox.cfc`, you can also use that in your Module Configuration object. So the same conventions that are used in the parent configuration can be used in the module; having the name of the environment match a method name in your module config. So if the following environments are declared in your parent configuration file and the **dev** environment is detected, the `dev()` method is called in your configuration object:

```javascript
environments = {
  dev = "^railo.*,^cf.*,^local.*"
};

function dev(){
  // my overrides here
  coldbox.handlerCaching = false;
}
```

But if you declare that `dev()` method in your Module Configuration object, it will be called as well **after** your `configure()` method is called:

```javascript
function configure(){}

function dev(){
  // override module settings for dev here.
}
```
