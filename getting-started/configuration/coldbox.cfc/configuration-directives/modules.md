# Modules

The modules structure is used to configure the behavior of the [ColdBox Modules](../../../../hmvc/modules/).

```javascript
modules = {
    // Will auto reload the modules in each request. Great for development but can cause some loading/re-loading issues
    autoReload = true,
    // An array of modules to load ONLY
    include = [],
    // An array of modules to EXCLUDE for operation
    exclude = [ "paidModule1", "paidModule2" ]
};
```

> **Danger** Please be very careful when using the `autoReload` flag as module routing can be impaired and thread consistency will also suffer. This is PURELY a development flag that you can use at your own risk.
