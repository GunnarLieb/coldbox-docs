# Configuration Directives

The basic configuration object has 1 method for application configuration called `configure()` where you will place all your configuration directives and settings:

{% code title="ColdBox.cfc" %}
```javascript
/**
* A simple CFC that configures a ColdBox application.  You can even extend, compose, strategize and do your OO goodness.
*/
component{

    // Mandatory configuration method
    function configure(){
        coldbox = {
          
        };
    }
    
}
```
{% endcode %}

## Directives

Inside of this configuration method you will place several core and third-party configuration structures that can alter your application settings and behavior. Below are the core directives you can define:
