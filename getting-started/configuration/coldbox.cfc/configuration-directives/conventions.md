# Conventions

This element defines custom conventions for your application. By default, the framework has a default set of conventions that you need to adhere too. However, if you would like to implement your own conventions for a specific application, you can use this setting, otherwise do not declare it:

```javascript
//Conventions
conventions = {
    handlersLocation = "controllers",
    viewsLocation      = "views",
    layoutsLocation  = "views",
    modelsLocation      = "model",
    modulesLocation  = "modules",
    eventAction      = "index"
};
```
