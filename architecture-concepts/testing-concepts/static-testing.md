# Static Testing

Static testing relies on human interaction not only with our code but with our developers and stakeholders. Some aspects can be code reviews, code/ui walkthroughs, design and modeling sessions, etc. Through experience, we can also attest that static testing is sometimes omitted or considered to be a waste of time. Especially when you need to hold up on production releases to review somebody else’s work. Not only that, but sometimes code reviews can spark animosity between developers and architects as most of the time the idea is to find holes in code, so careful tact must be in place and also maturity across development environments. In true fun we can say: `“Come on, take the criticism, it is for the common good!”`
